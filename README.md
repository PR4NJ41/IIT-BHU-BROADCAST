# IIT BHU BROADCAST

This Project was made using React js and Firebase.

### Deployment
 
I used Firebase to Host the site [Click Here To Go To THe Landing Page](https://iit-bhu-broadcast.web.app/)

I also used Vercel to Host the site [Click Here To Go To THe Vercel Landing Page](https://iit-bhu-broadcast.vercel.app/)

I Started the project on 15 April 2023 and Completed it by 16 April 2023 (yep in 24 hrs). I created this as an platform so that anyone can broadcast his/her Message to the Whole IIT BHU. Nowadays people use things like Facebook and Instagram. If my dreams comes true It will be a very great site Just for IIT BHU peoples. Also Since I started the project after the extension of deadline, I didn't get much time to work on this Project as there was an Electricity Failure. I wanted to add many feartures but couldn't. Although Its Completely based on Firebase. Features like google Auth And creating the Event/Story are added.

Also I would like to join COPS because of my Keen interest towards Software Development. Hope you Like my Project.

Thank you!
